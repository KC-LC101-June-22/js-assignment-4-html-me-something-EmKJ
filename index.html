        <p class="subtitle">Breakfast Flavored Glue?</p>
        <p>
          Oats are a great fit for a small budget. They are low effort and quick to cook when life gets busy. They're also healthy: good for your heart, gut and blood-sugar. They can help with weight loss and...on their own they are not much
          different from eating cardboard.
        </p>
        <p>I hope I can inspire you to add oats to your meals by showing you my favorite recipes (that arent glue-y or boring).</p>

          <h3>Homemade instant oatmeal</h3>
          <p>Packaged oatmeal is sometimes pricey, sometimes too sweet and often times glue-y. My favorite instant oatmeal recipe adds in flax and chia for more complex flavor, better texture and bonus healthy stuff!</p>
          <p>healthy stuff +1</p>
          <p>Then promptly adds in maple syrup and cream so it's not <em>too</em> healthy.</p>

            Add a pinch of salt. Adding salt can make sweet foods taste better. Because

          <h3>The case for savory oatmeal</h3>
          <p>
            What if you don't like sweet food? What if you just want to mix things up a bit in your kitchen? Most of the recipes and pre packaged oatmeal I see are sweet. Oatmeal can be savory too! Try adding veggies or cheese, cooking with stock
            instead of water, and even topping with a fried egg. Yum~

            Buy a digital scale and ditch your measuring cups. Using a scale lets you be sure that you've followed the recipe exactly right. You'll also (probably)make less dirty dishes and work faster! Need more convincing? Check out

          <h3>Bread</h3>
          <p>Here's one of my go-to bread recipes. It's only 7 ingredients and 4 steps. Start to finish it takes about 10 minutes of hands-on time. The addition of oatmeal makes this bread turn out super soft, just like store bought bread.</p>
          <p class="pro-tip">I like to substitute the honey for a 50/50 sugar/molasses mix. The molasses addition makes the bread similar in taste to the brown bread served at places like Cheesecake Factory and Outback Steakhouse.</p>

        <p>Basic oat structure: hull, bran, germ</p>
        <p>So glue-y, it actually <em>is</em> used as a glue extender</p>
        <p>Used in cosmetics because it's moisturizing for your skin. Also, just like it's a prebiotic for your gut, it can be a prebiotic for beneficial skin bacteria that effect things like psoriosis.</p>
